# task-tracker

Hey everyone its my task-tracker writed on Python/Django

You can look a code but instead cloning the project i'd recommend you look on this app on Heroku server by this link => "https://task-tracker-kanban-django.herokuapp.com/".

How use this web-site?
    It's very easy :) I create a user friendly design as more as i can. So enjoy your using my vision of task-tracker.
